This app help keep your bike on mode 4 (off-road) and speed 4 (4/4). It is a background process that periodically changes the bike into 4/4 mode. Obviously for off-road use only.

## Getting Started

- Open the app and select the "Start scan" button. This will find any bikes around you that are on and save the details into the app. 
- When you see your bike, stop the scan. 
- Select your bike in the list. 
- Then hit "Start watch". 
- While the watch is running your bike will reset to 4/4 mode around every 10 seconds.

**Make sure your bluetooth is on**
