Hey everyone! Creator of Superduper (https://github.com/blopker/superduper) here, the alternative app for your Super73 bike. I wanted to announce a new version was just released, 0.3.0 (32). Aside from updating various dependencies, including a major performance improvement on iOS, I've added the ability to delete bikes from the app. This is useful if you have a bike that you no longer have access to, or if you want to remove a bike from the app to make it easier to find the bike you want to connect to. Go to the bike you want to delete and tap the "Edit" button. There should be a "Delete" button at the bottom of the page.

The update should now be ready in TestFlight (https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tl0UibRY) and Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kbl.superduper). If you have any issues, please let me know here or on GitHub (https://github.com/blopker/superduper/issues). Happy riding!
